This project is for adjusment of table level from floor. It has also graphical interface where you can control the desk level and wlan plugs and bulbs.

it has rasbperry pi4, 7 inch touch screen, uln2804 chip, three relays and resistors. there is also gearbox motor what lift or lower the desk.
ultrasonic sensor measures the desk distance from floor and you can save your favorite setup and load it later. We can save all light and plugs setup and distance from floor.
